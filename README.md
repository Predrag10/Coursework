# Coursework

This repository has some projects that I have completed during my studies.
#
1. Fake-Real Game, this is an Android application created using Android Studio in Java. The game presents you with an image and you have to decide if the image is real or has been modified in any way, and how confident you are with your decision. After making your choice you can see the answer and how other people voted. The problem is that the database used to store this information no longer exists so seeing the results is not possible.

2. Genetic algorithm, simple implementation of this algorithm. The user specifices number of players and the size of the matrix. The players start in the top left corner and their goal is to reach the bottom right corner. All of them have a certain amount of moves. After all of the players have completed their moves the current generation ends and it mutates to better the next generation. After 1 player reaches the goal the algorithm ends. The user can view the progress in a simple Swing interface.

3. Koper Food, application created in Android Studio. Users can create an account and use it to view, post and comment on recipes. The functionalities implemented are the posting of recipes, posting comments, liking / disliking comments, searching for recipes by keyword in the name or by ingredients.

4. Memory Game, implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Simple memory game where the user enters his username (so his time can be stored). The user needs to match letter from the cyrillic alphabet with letters from the Latin alphabet. After the game is closed all scores are deleted.

5. Memory Game, implemented using Java. Similar to the previous implementation, except here the user needs to match numbers. He also has the possibility to use a hint, this makes his final score significantly worse. The GUI is implemented using Swing.
